I am currently an MSc student at McGill University and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/), focusing on Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. I am primarily supervised by [Professor Johannes Bjerva](https://bjerva.github.io/) at [Aalborg University Copenhagen](https://www.en.cph.aau.dk/).
