I am currently an MSc student at [Mcgill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/), focusing on Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. My main supervisor is [Timothy J. O'Donnell](http://people.linguistics.mcgill.ca/~timothy.odonnell/) and I am therefore part of the [Montreal Computational and Quantitative Linguistics Lab (MCQLL)](https://mcqll.org/) where I organize our weekly reading group-style meetings.
