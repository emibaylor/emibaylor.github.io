Hello and welcome!

I am currently a master's student in Computer Science at McGill University and Mila, focusing on Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing. My main supervisor is [Timothy J. O'Donnell](http://people.linguistics.mcgill.ca/~timothy.odonnell/) and I am therefore part of the [Montreal Computational and Quantitative Linguistics Lab (MCQLL)](https://mcqll.org/) where I organize our weekly reading group-style meetings.

This past summer, I worked as an intern on the [Mila AI for humanity team](https://mila.quebec/en/ai-society/), supervised by [Sasha Luccioni](https://mila.quebec/en/person/sasha-luccioni/) using NLP to help automate climate change-related analysis of financial disclosures.

Previously, I was an undergraduate student at McGill University, graduating with a Computer Science minor and a Linguistics Honours major.

In the summer of 2019, I was a participant in the [AI4Good Lab](https://www.ai4goodlab.com/), a 7-week program introducing women and gender minorities to AI and Machine Learning.
